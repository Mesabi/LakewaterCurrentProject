Unknown: ...
Unknown: Get up. 
Unknown: I will ask you 3 questions.
Unknown: You will then go about your day.
Unknown: You will answer these truthfully.
- Say Nothing
- Ask where you are.
	Unknown: You are dreaming.
Unknown: Question 1:
Unknown: Do you feel subject to the Machinations of Fate?
- Of Course, I am limited by actions outside of my control, and I am thus bound to certain outcomes.
	Unknown: Are you sure? 
	- Yes.
		Unknown: Understood.
	- No. 
		Unknown: Explain your hesitation.
		- I want to believe I am free... but I am know that I shouldn't be. I cannot fight fate.
			Unknown: ...
		- I can't really ever know, can I?
			Unknown: ...
		- I was saying what you wanted me to say.
			Unknown: I asked you to answer truthfully. 
			Unknown: This is a deviation from my commands.
			#player takes damage. 
	- ...
		Unknown: I will continue
- Of Course not, I am in control of my destiny. I, and I alone choose my path.
	Unknown: Are you sure? 
	- Yes.
		Unknown: Confirmed.
	- No. 
		Unknown: Explain the hesitation.
		- I want to believe I am free... but can I really know?
			Unknown: ...
		- What if I'm fated to believe I'm free?
			Unknown: When you are in the middle of things, you can never quite know.
Unknown: Question 2.
Unknown: Is there such a thing as perfection?
- Of course, there exists such a thing as a perfect outcome.
	Unknown: Do you feel that this is the case for this conversation?
	- Yes, there is an outcome that is 'more correct' in this series of questions.
		Unknown: ...
		Unknown: Let me account for this.
		#player takes damage.
		Unknown: Re-evalute your statement. Do you still believe there is an outcome that is 'more correct'?
		- Yes
			Unknown: ...
			Unknown: Do you believe you are answering towards a perfect outcome?
			-Yes FIX ME
			#create a block elsewhere for this.
			-No FIX ME
		- No
			Unknown: ...
			Unknown: I will continue.
	- Yes, the perfect outcome is that I tell the truth. 
		Unknown: Have you done so?
		- Yes
			Unknown: Thank you for your honesty. 
		- No
			Unknown: ...
			Unknown: I will account for this going forwards.
	- No, while perfection exists, it is not omnipresent. Some things cannot be made perfect.
		Unknown: I will continue,
- No, perfection is subjective. 
	Unknown: ...
	
Unknown: Question 3.
Unknown: Are you immutable?
- Yes, I am unable to change aspects of myself.
- No, I am a fluid being and can change.
