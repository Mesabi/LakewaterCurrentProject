#TODO NOTETAKING SPACE

#todo: 
#BACK SHIT UP TO GIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#1 organize scenes in file explorer. THEN refactor everything .-.
# -managers should be in their own folder
# -global and states need to be in their own folder <-done
# -tests and random crap need to go in their own folder
# - old scripts should go in their own folder
# -delete or rename duplicate titled items
# -scenes is too generic. decide on scripts + scenes on same folder or divide them
#2 change player states to an enum.
# - hold off on this until roughly all states have been figured out.
#3 get state variables to properly interact with dialog
# sort of done? refer to docs as necessary
#4 update dialog manager to align with theme.
# or at the very least, switch font. "II" looks like "||" currently. 
#5 enemy paradigm
